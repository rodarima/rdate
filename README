rdate - A small tool to show the date in an unusual format.

The objective is to not confuse anymore 9th of June with the 6th of September.

The date is formed by the following format, WITHOUT any other option.

	YYYY = Full year
	M = The computed char of the month
	D/DD = Day of the month

Finally:

	YYYYMD
	or
	YYYYMDD

No other options are possible. The char of the month is assigned based on the
first non used char in the name of the month:

	Month     Computed   Used
	January   J
	February  F          J
	March     M          JF
	April     A          JFM
	May       Y          JFMA
	June      U          JFMAY
	July      L          JFMAYU
	August    G          JFMAYUL
	September S          JFMAYULG
	October   O          JFMAYULGS
	November  N          JFMAYULGSO
	December  D          JFMAYULGSON

So for the month i in [1,12] the c code computing the char is quite simple:

	const char month[] = "JFMAYULGSOND";
	char c = month[i-1];

Also, the number of the day is 1 or 2 digits. NEVER a leading zero is used, to
avoid confusion with the O of October.
